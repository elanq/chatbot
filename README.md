# Introduction
EQBot is my attempt to communicate people through chat robot to help what they want. Currently this robot only supports product searching in bukalapak.com. I intend to scale up this bot capability such as making ticket reservation, purchasing product, remind for meeting, and anything to help them

# Why not mobile apps?
Sure, mobile apps provide better way for interaction and still the number one choice nowadays. But I believe that in future, robot or AI assistance is way more convenient rather than switching different apps to accomplish something.
